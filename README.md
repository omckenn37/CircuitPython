# CircuitPython
These are my CircuitPython assigments that I have done.

## Hello CircuitPython
### Description 
In this assignment, I used the new metro boards along with the new language, Circuitpython. I used this to make an LED fade from on to of.

### Lessons Learned
This assignment was a bit tough becuase it was our first experience with Circuitpython, Metro, and Mu. I had to google a lot of stuff, such as how to set up a pin for a LED and how to make it fade. The syntax between Circuitpython and the arduino language is very different, meaning there is not really any crossover. We had to essentially learn how to do things all over again.

This is a quick Fritzing of this assignment. As you can see, it is very simple to wire.

## Servo with Capacitive Touch
### Description
In this assignment, I used two wires to control a servo. Touching one wire turned the servo towards 0, while touching the other wire turned the servo towards 180. 

### Lessons Learned
This assignment was hard because it was the first time I used a PWM pin. The setup is different from analog and gital pins, so we had to do a bit of research to figure out how to set it up. Also, we used capacitive touch for the first time. This enabled us to control the servo without having any buttons.

## LCD With Button
### Description
In this assignment, I used an LCD screen, button, and a switch. The objective was to be able to display the number of times a button was pressed on the LCD screen. The switch was there to switch the direction of the counting. For example, one state would count up, and the other would count down. 

### Lessons Learned
We used a button and a switch for the first time in this assignment. Like everything else, we had to look up how to use buttons and switches. In the end the code wasn't very hard. We did have a bit of issues with the timing. Sometimes, the LCD would count twice, and sometimes it would count at all. We had to mess around with the delays a bit and find the right timing.

## Photointerrupter
### Description
In this assignment, we used a photointerruper and displayed the number of interruptions every 4 seconds. In addition,
